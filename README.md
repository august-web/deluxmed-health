## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

## Key navigation element: Learn About Telehealth

The primary call-to-action link for telehealth is the “Learn About Telehealth” element on the home page service area section. It is implemented as a styled React Router `<Link>` and:

- Navigates to `/telehealth-maryland` without a full page reload.
- Uses the shared button styles for consistent visual appearance and accessible focus-visible states.
- Meets WCAG 2.1 AA expectations for keyboard focus visibility and target size.

## Testing

Automated tests are implemented with Vitest and Testing Library.

- To run the test suite:

```sh
npm test
```

Current tests include checks that:

- The “Learn About Telehealth” link renders with the correct `href`.
- The link inherits accessible focus-visible styles.
- Clicking the link from the home page navigates to the Telehealth page.
